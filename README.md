# SokobanLevelGenerator

A less specific version of the level generator for my game [Soko ZenInfinite](https://burningbitz.itch.io/soko-zen-infinite). It still requires a ['global' singleton though.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/singletons_autoload.html) This code isn't intended to be run *as is*, but to be built upon and studied. I hope however sometime in the future I'll be able to rewrite the code (along with improving it) in C++.
